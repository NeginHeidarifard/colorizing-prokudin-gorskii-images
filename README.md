## Project Overview

This project focuses on reconstructing color photographs from early 20th-century grayscale glass plate negatives captured by **Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii**. Each image contains three vertically stacked grayscale channels taken with Red, Green, and Blue filters. Our goal is to extract and align these layers to produce high-quality color images.

This assignment offers a practical exercise in classical computer vision, image alignment, and real-world signal reconstruction.

##  Objectives

- Extract R, G, and B channels from the scanned plates  
- Align color channels using various computer vision techniques  
- Improve visual quality using cropping and contrast enhancement  
- Evaluate performance based on alignment accuracy and visual fidelity

## ðŸ”§ Techniques Implemented

###  1. Naive Channel Splitting
- Splits the image vertically into three channels (B, G, R)
- Produces highly misaligned color images without further processing

###  2. Sum of Squared Differences (SSD)
- Uses brute-force search to find the best displacement
- Measures pixel-wise similarity across small shift ranges

###  3. Canny Edge Alignment
- Improves robustness using edge-based similarity instead of raw pixel values
- Reduces sensitivity to lighting and texture differences

###  4. Image Pyramid Alignment
- Applies recursive downsampling and alignment at multiple resolutions
- Speeds up search and handles large misalignments

###  5. Contour-Based Matching
- Aligns edges using Canny and Sobel filters
- Suitable for high-resolution images with structural features

##  Results and Enhancements

- **Post-processing**:  
  - Cropping black borders  
  - Histogram Equalization in YCrCb space for contrast improvement  

- **Performance**:  
  - Achieved visually accurate color alignment  
  - Verified with qualitative assessment of facial features and textures
